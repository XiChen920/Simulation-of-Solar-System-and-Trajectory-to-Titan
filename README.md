How to run the code?
-------------------
Run the main method within the Launcher class. This will start the engine and the GUI.

How to use the engine?
----------------------
Camera movement
- To move around, use the "w" (up),"a" (left) ,"s" (down) ,"d" (right) keys
- To zoom in, use "e". To zoom out, use "q".
- "0" to go to the origin of the plane

Time controls
- Hold "space" to pauze the engine
- Press "delete" to reset the engine to t0 (1 april 2020)
- Use "-" to slow down engine and "=" to speed it up.
- Use "[" to decrement stepsize and "]" to increment it.
- to in/decrement more, hold "shift" to increment engine speed or stepsize by 10, 
hold "control" to increment engine speed or stepsize by 100.

In order to switch between the different solvers, use the following keys (this will reset the time to t0):
- "1" for Euler's method
- "2" for Runge-Kutta method
- "3" for Verlet's method

Switch between states
- "arrow up" to go to a different state (landerstate to modelingstate and vice versa)
